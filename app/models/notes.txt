Seed sequelize with a json file: https://github.com/domasx2/sequelize-fixtures

//////////

To add a new project to a user and set its status, you pass an extra object to the setter, which contains the attributes for the join table

user.addProject(project, { status: 'started' })

By default the code above will add projectId and userId to the UserProjects table, and remove any previously defined primary key attribute - the table will be uniquely identified by the combination of the keys of the two tables, and there is no reason to have other PK columns. To enforce a primary key on the UserProjects model you can add it manually.

UserProjects = sequelize.define('userProjects', {
  id: {
    type: Sequelize.INTEGER,
    primaryKey: true,
    autoIncrement: true
  },
  status: DataTypes.STRING
})
With Belongs-To-Many you can query based on through relation and select specific attributes. For example using findAll with through

User.findAll({
  include: [{
    model: Project,
    through: {
      attributes: ['createdAt', 'startedAt', 'finishedAt'],
      where: {completed: true}
    }
  }]
});
